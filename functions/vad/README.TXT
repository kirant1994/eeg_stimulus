Noise robust voice activity detection algorithm (rVAD).
Version 1.0
10 Nvo 2014

Usage: vad(finwav, fpitch, fvad, vadThres); or vad(finwav, fpitch, fvad).

finwav: The input WAVE file path and name.% fpitch: The pitch file path and name. If the pitch file exists, pitch information is loaded; otherwise, the pitch information will be extracted and saved to the file in Matlab format.
fvad: The output VAD file path and name. Each line in the file contains the start frame number and the end frame number for a speech segment. The frame shift is 10ms.
vadThres: The threshold for VAD. The default value is 0.1 [optinal]. Increasing vadThres (e.g. to 0.2) makes the VAD more aggressive, i.e. the speech segment will be shortened.
foutwav: The output denoised speech file path and name [optional]. This is to be specified only if denoised speech output is desired.
